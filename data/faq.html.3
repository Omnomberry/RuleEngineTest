<h1>Frequently Asked Questions on ISGCI</h1>

<h2>General</h2>

<div class="faq">
<p>How do I cite ISGCI?</p>

<p>If you want to cite a particular page, then you can use the data given in
the footer of that page. For the system in general, use the data in the footer of the <a href="index.html">home page</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<p>I want to look for some particular data in your system, but its query
features are too simple for my complicated question. What can I do now?</p>

<p>
Answer 1: Please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> us. We might be able to
help you by doing a direct query on the database. This will also help us to
improve ISGCI, by letting us know the things people actually (want to) do with
ISGCI.
</p>

<p>
Answer 2: The <a href="http://www.sagemath.org">Sage</a> mathematics system
contains a copy of the ISGCI database (sage.graphs.isgci), which you can
investigate with the full power of Python at your disposal. Note that this
database may not be fully up to date in comparison to
<a href="index.html">www.graphclasses.org</a>.

<div class="faq">
<p>Can I contribute to ISGCI?</p>

<p>Probably. What are your interests? Why don't you drop us an <a
href="contact.html">email</a>?

<div class="faq">
<p>What are those weird g6: texts for every smallgraph?</p>

<p>It is the definition of the graph in <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt">graph6 format</a>. You can copy&amp;paste this to import the graph into e.g. <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/graph.html#graph-format">Sage</a> or <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/format/Graph6.html">Mathematica</a>. You may need to escape special characters, like backslashes; see the aforementioned links.

<h2>The Java application</h2>
<div class="faq">
<p>Which version of Java do I need?</p>

<p>
You need at least version 1.6. You can download the latest version of Java
<a href="http://java.com/en/download/">here</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<p>When I click on the application, I get a download dialog and when I click
OK, the application is not started?</p

<p>Did you install java? You need at least version 1.6. You can download the
latest version of Java <a href="http://java.com/en/download/">here</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<p>When I click on the application, all I get is some XML code?</p>

<div class="faq">
<p>Can I use the application offline?</p>

<p>Yes, you can. Start the java control panel jcontrol and click
<em>View...</em> in the pane <em>Temporary Internet Files</em>. A dialog
opens with the cached java applications. On ISGCI, use the context menu
under the right mouse button to run the application offline. Note that
functionality that requires access to the ISGCI server will not work, e.g.
filtering graphclasses or viewing class details.
</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<p>Under unix, when I click 'help' or 'smallgraphs' or 'class details' in
the app, nothing happens?</p>

<p>These menu items try to open a new browser window to display the
requested information. If the app can't find the proper browser, nothing
will happen.
</p>
<p>
Check in the Java control panel (jcontrol), tab Advanced, whether the
<em>Command to launch default browser</em> is correct. If it is, but these
menu items still do not work and your system uses the shared mime database,
then you need to specify the default application for html files:
</p>
<p>
First find the .desktop file for your favourite browser, typically it will
be in /usr/share/applications, e.g.
/usr/share/applications/mozilla-firefox-3.5.desktop.
Then edit the file ~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list, creating it
first, if necessary. The first line of this file should be
</p>
<pre>[Default Applications]</pre>
<p>At the bottom of the file add the line</p>
<pre>text/html=mozilla-firefox-3.5.desktop</pre>
<p>
where the text after the equals sign = should be the name of the desktop
file (without path) of your browser.
</p>

<h2>The database</h2>

<div class="faq">
<p>I can't find inclusion A &lt; B, class X, algorithm Y in ISGCI? There's a
mistake in your database!</p>

<p>Please <a href="contact.html">mail</a> us!</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<p>Is there a way to get raw relationship data out of ISGCI, could I maybe get
a copy of your database?</p>

<p>
The easiest way to get relationship data out of ISGCI is to create a drawing of
the classes that interest you (e.g. all subclasses of perfect graphs) and
choose File/Export drawing. Then choose the GraphML format. This will export
the classes and the relations between them as drawn, but without layout
information.
</p>

<p>
Depending on your goals, this may not be enough. Maybe you would be served
better with the XML file containing the relations, or with an online
query possibility. Principally such solutions are possible, but we would
need to know what you're trying to achieve, so we can decide on the best way
to help you.
For example, the <a href="http://www.sagemath.org">Sage</a> mathematics system
contains such a copy of the ISGCI database (sage.graphs.isgci), which you can
investigate with the full power of Python at your disposal. Note that this
database may not be fully up to date in comparison to
<a href="index.html">www.graphclasses.org</a>.

<div class="faq">
<p>Is it possible to have simple graphs available in adjacency list or matrix representation?</p>

<p>Yes, it is. The smallgraphs have next to their name a string preceded by
g6:. This string is the
<a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt">graph6</a> encoding of
the graph. The graph6 format can be read by e.g. sage and mathematica, which
you can use to do all sorts of nice calculations on the graph. If all you want
is an adjacency list or matrix representation of the graph, you can use the
<a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.html">showg</a> program.

<div class="faq">
<p>I published an article with results that would fit right into your database.
Can I send it to you?</p>

<p>
Yes you can. The rules for adding data to ISGCI are simple: First, we must
believe the result. This means it's published in a refereed journal or
conference, or be so short that we can verify it ourselves. Second, it must fit
in. Roughly speaking, this means that the classes described are of the type
studied in algorithmic graph theory. If your article describes relations
between your new class and classes that exist already in ISGCI, it should fit
right in.
</p>
<p>
If your article describes a new algorithm for a problem that is already in
ISGCI, it will probably fit in. If the algorithm is for a problem that is not
yet in ISGCI, we still appreciate to hear of it, but we will put it on our "to
do" list, until we have gathered enough algorithms to add a new problem.
</p>
<p>
We don't judge whether articles are "important" or "interesting".
When in doubt, just <a href="contact.html">send</a> us your article.
