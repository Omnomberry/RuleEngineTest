	 <h2>What is ISGCI?</h2>
	 ISGCI is an encyclopaedia of graphclasses with an accompanying java
	 application that helps you to research what's known about particular
	 graph classes. You can:
	 <ul>
	    <li>check the relation between graph classes and get a witness for
	    the result</li>
	    <li>draw clear inclusion diagrams</li>
	    <li>colour these diagrams according to the complexity of selected
	    problems</li>
	    <li>find the P/NP boundary for a problem</li>
	    <li>save your diagrams as Postscript, GraphML or SVG files</li>
	    <li>find references on classes, inclusions and algorithms</li>
	 </ul>
