<p>
The 'browse database' window. Currently the Berge graphs are selected. The
window shows complexity of the Independent Set problem on Berge graphs
(polynomial) and its super-, sub-, and equivalent classes.

alt="Complexity boundary for independent set"></a>
<p>
The boundary between polynomial/NP-complete for the 
Independent Set problem, as seen when starting from bridged
graphs. Red classes are NP-Complete, dark green are polynomial,
light green are linear, while white are still open.

Finding and drawing the relation between $2K<sub>2</sub>$ and
$(2K<sub>2</sub>,C<sub>4</sub>,C<sub>5</sub>)$-free graphs. The system calculates that $(2K<sub>2</sub>,C<sub>4</sub>,C<sub>5</sub>)$-free graphs are a subclass of $2K<sub>2</sub>$-free graphs and draws all classes that are superset of one and a subset of the other class.
